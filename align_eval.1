sort algorithm complexity

'align_eval sort' is a general merge-sort algorithm using an index.
Its complexity is the following, with the following constants:

N: number of lines to be sorted
G: number of contigs in the genome
C: number of chunks



1.  N * log(G): read through entire file, computing an index from it.
2.  --: partition the index into quantiles based on file offset (already sorted, nothing to do)
3.  C * N/C * log(N/C): sorting each chunk by key
4.  (C-1) *  N/2: partition index into quantiles based on key value
5.  (C-1) *  N/2: re-partition by offset quantiles
6.  C * N/C * log(N/C): sort each offset-partition of the index by key
7.  C * C * N/C: inplace_merge of pieces of each temporary file

(Note: step 7 can have worst-case behavior: C * C * N/C log(N/C)
